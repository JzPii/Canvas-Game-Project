This is a simple Canvas-based game that requires a solid understanding of the principles of JavaScript programming to customize. 

## Instruction
![](images/instr.gif)

The code monster is devouring me piece by piece. Help me to escape them.
Monster is evolved every 5 second.
There are 6 levels in total of 30 seconds.
Beat the boss and I will have time to spend with my princess just like Mario.

The game was really fun to work on. It helps me to understand some very basic principles of Javascript canvas. I was not able to realize which part should be prioritized and that was why I could not estimate the ETA.
